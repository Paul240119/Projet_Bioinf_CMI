# Initialize the matrix
The first two lines simply calculate the lengths of the two sequences, which will be used to determine the dimensions of the matrix. The **matrix** variable is then initialized as a 2D list of zeros with **n+1** rows and **m+1** columns. The **+1** is added to allow for gaps to be included in the alignment.  
This loop initializes the first column of the matrix. Since the first sequence will be aligned to gaps in the second sequence, each cell in the first column is given a value equal to **i * gap_penalty**, where **i** is the row number. This assigns increasing gap penalties as the length of the gap increases.  
Same for **j * gape_penalty**, **j** for column number.    
# Fill in the matrix  
**diagonal_score** is the score for aligning **seq1[i-1]** with **seq2[j-1]** and can be computed by looking at the diagonal cell in the matrix and adding the match score if the two characters match, or the mismatch penalty if they don't match.  
**left_score** is the score for aligning **seq1[i-1]** with a gap, and can be computed by looking at the cell to the left in the matrix and adding the gap penalty.  
**up_score** is the score for aligning **seq2[j-1]** with a gap, and can be computed by looking at the cell above in the matrix and adding the gap penalty.  
Finally, the maximum of these three scores is stored in the current cell in the matrix, as this represents the best possible score for aligning the two substrings up to that point.  
The resulting matrix will contain the optimal alignment scores for all possible substrings of the two input sequences.  
# Trace back through the matrix to find the alignment  
This part of the code is responsible for tracing back through the matrix to find the optimal alignment between the two input sequences. The algorithm starts at the bottom right corner of the matrix (corresponding to the end of both sequences) and works its way towards the top left corner (corresponding to the beginning of both sequences).  
The first part of the code initializes the alignment strings, **align1** and **align2**, to empty strings. It also initializes **i** and **j** to the lengths of the two sequences, which is the starting position for the traceback.  
The while loop iterates while **i** and **j** are both greater than zero. Within the loop, there are three conditional statements that determine which cell in the matrix the current cell was derived from. If the current cell was derived from the diagonal cell, this means that the two corresponding characters from **seq1** and **seq2** must have been aligned (either as a match or a mismatch), so these characters are added to **align1** and **align2**. If the current cell was derived from the cell to the left, this means that a gap was inserted into **seq1**, so a dash is added to **align1** and the corresponding character from seq2 is added to **align2**. Finally, if the current cell was derived from the cell above, this means that a gap was inserted into **seq2**, so a dash is added to **align2** and the corresponding character from **seq1** is added to **align1**.  
After the while loop completes, there may be remaining characters in one of the sequences that were not aligned. These characters are added to the beginning of the appropriate alignment string using two additional while loops. If there are remaining characters in **seq2**, then dashes are added to **align1** and the remaining characters from **seq2** are added to **align2**. If there are remaining characters in **seq1**, then dashes are added to **align2** and the remaining characters from seq1 are added to **align1**.  
Overall, this part of the code implements a traceback algorithm to determine the optimal alignment between the two input sequences based on the dynamic programming matrix that was previously constructed. The result is two strings that represent the aligned sequences, where dashes indicate gaps in the alignment.  
# Calculate the identity, similarity, and gaps  
This part of the code calculates the alignment statistics, such as the length of the alignment, the number of identical positions, the number of similar positions, and the number of gaps in the alignment.  
* **length** is simply the length of the aligned sequences.  
* **identity** is calculated by iterating over the aligned sequences with **zip(align1, align2)** and counting the number of positions where the characters are the same. This gives the number of positions that are identical in both sequences in the alignment.  
* **similarity** is calculated by iterating over the aligned sequences with **zip(align1, align2)** and counting the number of positions where the characters are either the same, or at least one of them is a gap ('-'). This gives the number of positions that are either identical or similar in both sequences in the alignment.  
* **gaps** is calculated by iterating over the aligned sequences with **zip(align1, align2)** and counting the number of positions where at least one of the characters is a gap ('-'). This gives the total number of gaps in the alignment.  
Note that the **sum()** function is used in all of the above calculations, with a generator expression that yields 1 for each position that meets the specified criteria (i.e., identical, similar, or gapped). The **zip()** function is used to iterate over the aligned sequences position by position.  
# Calculate the score  
This part of the code calculates the score of the alignment by iterating over each position of the two aligned sequences and adding the appropriate score based on whether the characters at that position are identical, mismatched, or there is a gap in one or both sequences.  
The score starts at 0 and is incremented based on the following rules:  
If either character in the aligned sequences is a gap '-', then the score is incremented by the gap penalty value.  
If the characters at the current position in the aligned sequences are identical, then the score is incremented by the match score value.  
If the characters at the current position in the aligned sequences are different, then the score is incremented by the mismatch penalty value.  
At the end of the loop, the variable 'score' holds the final score of the alignment.
